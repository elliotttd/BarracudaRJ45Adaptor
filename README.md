# BarracudaRJ45Adaptor
Adaptor to replace WAN/LAN sockets on Barracuda WSG410

Replaces the internal circuit board which the WAN&LAN ports sit on so that you can use your own network card(s)

The link lights will no longer work as the NIC you install will most likely have their own. This card is essentially just an RJ45 Coupler. 

Tested up to 2500mpbs. YMMV...


4x RJ45 sockets required. 
  Max Dimensions: ~17mm wide x ~13.8mm tall
  standard 2.5mm pitch. Magjacks won't work.
  
  Here's what I used, I just bought them on eBay:

I left all of the default settings on when getting the pcb's manufactured. 
  2 Layers, 1.6ish mm thickness
 

This is how my firewall turned out:
